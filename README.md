<h1>Auto-Camera</h1>
A World of Warcraft addon that dynamically zooms the camera in and out based on your character's actions and surroundings.

<h2>Stand-By</h2>
- Stand-By mode suspends automatic camera zooming which can be useful in some situations.<br/>
- By default the camera zooms to View 5 (Views are configurable camera distances available in the base game). This behavior can be changed in the "/ac settings" panel.<br/>
- You can toggle Stand-By with a macro ("/ac toggle") or a key binding which can be set in the "/ac settings" panel.<br/>
- Auto-Camera enters Stand-By automatically for the duration of some events (e.g. boss encounters and pet battles).<br/>

<h2>Camera Distances</h2>
Camera distances for various contexts can be configured in the "/ac settings" panel.<br/>
