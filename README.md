<h1>Auto-Camera</h1>
A World of Warcraft addon that automates and augments the camera's functionality and control.

<h2>Automatic Zooming</h2>
- While active, this feature smoothly transitions camera distance based on various configurable contexts (e.g. running, riding, fighting an enemy, fighting a bunch of enemies, etc.)<br/>
- Stand-By mode allows the player to quickly disable automatic zooming if necessary.<br/>
    - By default the camera zooms to View 5 (Views are configurable camera distances available in the base game). This behavior can be changed in the "/ac settings" panel.<br/>
    - You can toggle Stand-By with a macro ("/ac toggle") or a key binding which can be set in the "/ac settings" panel.<br/>
    - Auto-Camera enters Stand-By automatically for the duration of some events (e.g. boss encounters and pet battles).<br/>

<h2>Action Cam Interface</h2>
- Provides an settings interface for the base game's experimental Action Cam feature.<br/>
